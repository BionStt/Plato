# Contributing guidelines

Weâ€™d love you to help us improve Plato. To help us keep this Plato
high quality, we request that contributions adhere to the following guidelines.

- Try to include descriptive commit messages, even if you squash them before sending a pull request. Good commit messages are important. They tell others why you did the changes you did, not just right here and now, but months or years from now.
- Commit messages should be clear, concise and provide a reasonable summary to give an indication of what was changed and why.
- Avoid committing several unrelated changes in one go. It makes merging difficult, and also makes it harder to determine which change is the culprit if a bug crops up.
- If you aren't sure how something works or want to solicit input from other Plato developers before making a change, you can create an issue with the discussion tag or post your quesitons to https://plato.instantasp.co.uk/questions.
- Please include relevant unit tests / specs along with your changes, if appropriate.
